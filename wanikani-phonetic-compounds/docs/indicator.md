# The Quality Indicator

Using kanji as the Japanese writing system has a long and winding history, which had a huge influence on the way kanji are written and read. 

When it comes to phonetic compounds, this unfortunately lead to a decrease in usefulness of the phonetic hints that Keisei aims to teach. From importing kanji readings from different Chinese dialects over centuries, converting Chinese sounds to their Japanese equivalents, to script reforms that altered the shapes of some kanji, the relation between expected readings from a phonetic mark and the actual readings may be blurred or even lost.

The *quality indicator* is there to help you to identify if a phonetic mark is useful or not for a certain kanji. It is shown in the upper left corner of each kanji compound, and shows three different features.

1. Quality level (one of 天上中下)
2. Obscurity (can you still see the phonetic mark?)
3. Dakuten equality (Simple sound changes present?)

# Quality Level

## Perfect Match (天 Indicator)

This indicator shows that *all* modern readings are derived from the phonetic mark. Just looking at the phonetic component will give you the correct readings. This holds true for kanji that have multiple readings, the phonetic mark must have these as well.

### Example:
* Phonetic mark 兪 (*death star*, phonetic ゆ)
* Phonetic compound 輸 (all compounds are read as ゆ only)

## Good Match (上 Indicator)

This indicator shows that a kanji is *generally* read as the phonetic mark suggests, but there are rare cases where the reading differs (maybe even outside of what is listed in the Jouyou list. If is sufficient to associate the phonetic mark with the kanji, but beware of surprises.

### Example
* Phonetic mark 圣 (*tombstone*, phonetic けい)
* Phonetic compound 経 (modern reading けい, but when related to sutras read as きょう, for example 写経, 説経)

## Bad Match (中 Indicator)

This indicator shows that a kanji is *generally **not*** read as indicated by the phonetic mark, but there are still cases where the mark fits. Best to remember these as exceptions.

## No Match (下 Indicator)

This indicator shows that the kanji reading has no relation to the phonetic mark at all. The reading may be altered, replaced by something else, or it may not be a phonetic compound after all.

### Example
* Phonetic mark 同 (*same*, phonetic どう)
* Phonetic compound 筒 (reading とう)

In the example the reading of 筒 may have been altered from どう to とう over time, while the phonetic mark remained. In this case the phonetic mark is arguably still helpful. See the section on the *dakuten mode* to improve the indicator in these cases.

# Kanji Obscurity Indicator

The kanji usage in Japan was subject to several reforms, for example to limit the number of essential kanji or to make handwriting easier. Some may say that this did more harm than good; for phonetic compounds this means that some kanji don't actually look like they contain a phonetic mark, but the readings still apply. 

Such kanji are marked with a yellow background color in the indicator circle.

### Example

* 跡 is actually related to 責, its old form was 蹟. The phonetic component was replaced by 赤, which has the same reading, but was only rarely used in phonetic compounds.

# Dakuten Mode

You can change the settings to consider slight sound changes like しょう <-> じょう <-> ちょう or か <-> が as equivalent, which boosts the quality indicator.
